# Java ee rest api playground

* java ee 7.0
* jersey
* arquillian
* etc.

## Deployment

For now I dont have automatic deployment set up. Run

`mvn -f BooksApi/pom.xml package`

This will generate a `BooksApi-ear/target/booksapi.ear` which you can manually deploy to payara.
If the tests fail but you still want to deploy for some crazy reason ðŸ˜ˆ, you can skip the tests with

`mvn -f BooksApi/pom.xml -DskipTests package`

## Testing

Run tests with `mvn -f BooksApi/pom.xml  test`. This will run the default profile `remote-server` which requires a glassfish/payara server to be started.
This is why there is also `mvn -f BooksApi/pom.xml test -Pembedded-server` which will boot a payara-embedded instance for each test.
